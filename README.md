# api-hackathon
A front-end JavaScript application that utilizes the Google Maps API and the Skyscanner API (through RapidAPI's hosting) to allow a user to generate a random city to travel to.
* Displays a map, the flight details, and a link to Skyscanner to book plane tickets. 

*Please note: this application uses RapidAPI's hosting of cached Skyscanner data. Thus, the flight quotes are not always accurate or do not return flight results even if there is an available flight. However, there is a button that will redirect you to Skyscanner to get a proper flight quote.*
